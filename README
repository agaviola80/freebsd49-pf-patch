Porting OpenBSD pf to FreeBSD 4.9

Packet filter or simply "pf" is a stateful firewall software that has
been part of the OpenBSD project since OpenBSD 3.0 release.
It was originally developed by Daniel Hartmeier (https://www.benzedrine.ch/kerneltrap.html).
This version of pf were sourced from the OpenBSD 3.2 release, were it
is capable of supporting network address translation (nat, binat and 
redirection), packet filtering (IPv4 and IPv6), packet normalization
and packet logging through pflog interface. Pf software is licensed under BSD.

Though FreeBSD 4.9-RELEASE is long time outdated, pf is ported to have it supported.
